        <h4>What does a Typical Day Look Like?</h4>
        <p>
            I would go to different client offices and audit the financial statements as well as systems of controls over loss etc. 
            I would also prepare certain areas on the financial statements (e.g. fixed assets and liabilities) for review by senior associates.

        <h4>What Qualities Make You Successful In This Field?</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Curiousness</strong> is needed, you need to be able to ask why a certain decision was made or why something is happening. 
            <strong>Skepticism</strong> is needed, you cannot accept what the company accepts without proof. 
            It is also important to be <strong>personable</strong>, you are not going to get help from your client unless they can work with you. 
            The last thing is <strong>Knowing your subject matter (accounting principles)</strong>. 
            It is crucial that you are able to apply the right principles/rules in a given situation. ​
