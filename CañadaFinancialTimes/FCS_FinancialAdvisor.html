        <h4>Introduction​</h4>
        <p>
            Here are some ways to budget your money as a beginner by using the 50/30/20 budget method. 
            50 percent is using your income for needs, 30 percent should be used for wants, and 20% 
            should be dedicated to savings and debt repayments. 
        </p>

        <h4>Core Lesson​</h4>
        <ul>

        <h4>How Can You Use This?</h4>
        <p>
            To start using this budgeting method you need to break down your income and expenses. 
            For example, Mario, who lives by himself, earns $2,000 a month($24k annually), 
            he is thinking of using the 50/30/20 budget method. 
            The way he would use this is spending $1,000 on necessities, $600 on wants, and $400 on savings, debt repayments, or investing. 
            The 50 percent, which is necessities, Mario would spend on buying groceries, paying his bills(rent and utilities), using transportation(gas or transit fee), basic utilities , and child care(if he ever decides to settle down). 
            Secondly, 30 percent which are wants will be spent on shopping, gifts, travel, going out to eat, and entertainment. 
            Finally, 20 percent will be spent on saving up for his future, pay off debt, and putting money into his investment portfolio.​
