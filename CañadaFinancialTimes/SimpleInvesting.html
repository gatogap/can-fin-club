        <h4>Introduction​</h4>
        <p>
            Investing in stocks can seem like a gamble, and with all of the uncertainties, even the most successful investors admit that it sometimes is. 
            For this edition of the Cañada Financial Times, we are going to take a look at a simple investing strategy from Dan Nathan. 
        </p>

        <h4>“Spoos, Qs, and 2s”​</h4>
        <p>
            If you don’t know what that phrase means, do not panic. 
            This phrase is coined by Dan Nathan of CNBC’s Fast Money talk show, and host of On The Tape podcast. 
            He recommends this simple investing strategy that stands the test of time, works in the long run, and is supposed to work no matter when you decide to invest. 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The “Spoos” refers to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) which mimics the S&P500 index, essentially a compilation of the 500 largest publicly listed companies in the United States. </li>
            <li>The “Qs” refer to the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) which mimics the Nasdaq-100 composite index, a compilation of the 100 largest publicly listed companies traded on the NASDAQ(online stock exchange), except for financial companies like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.</li>
            <li>Finally, the “2s” refer to 2-year treasury bonds.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The philosophy behind this investment strategy is that all three of these securities not only have traditionally risen over time, but they are a very simple way to diversify your investments. 
            With the “Qs”, you are investing in the top 100 companies, which will be carried by the top 6-7 companies heavily. 
            With the “Spoos”, you would be investing across 500 different companies and essentially insuring that your portfolio is not tanked by the Nasdaq 100. With the “2s”, you are diversifying the assets you are choosing to invest in so that you are not overly exposed to the equities market(the stock market). 
            <br><br> Take a look at the chart for each and see how it has gone up over time. 
            However, remember that nothing is ever guaranteed so make sure to always diversify and only invest money you have!
            <br><br>
            Use this tool to see what an investment in SPY could have returned depending on what year the investment was made:

        </p>

       <p>If an investor put money into the QQQ and reinvested their returns, they could have gotten a: ​<pl>
        <ul>
        <li>23% yearly return if they had begun 5 years ago ($100 would have turned into $281)</li>
        <li>27% yearly return if they had begun 3 years ago ($100 would have turned into $204)​</li>
        <li>14% yearly return if they had begun 1 year ago ( $100 would have turned into $114)​</li>
        </ul>
