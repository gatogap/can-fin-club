                <h4>Introduction​</h4>
                <p>
                    There are numerous articles exclaiming that March's Silicon Valley's bank crash was the 
                    largest since 2008's housing crises.<br>
                    Were the circumstances the same? Was the government at play? In a matter of fact, while 
                    high interest rates did impact Silicon Valley's long term bonds with corporations like Roblox, 
                    there were major flaws within the bank. Let's take a deeper look...

            <h4>The How and the Why:​</h4>
            <p>
                Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) provided financing for about half of all venture funded technology and healthcare companies in the United States. SVB was favored by most startups, particularly tech-startups, because of their willingness to support such companies when most other banks would consider them high risk. Their willingness to support such companies was largely due to the pandemic, when there was a thriving market for tech companies. With a large influx of cash, SVB’s services were in high demand, specifically their ability to hold cash for things like payroll. With all this cash, SVB invested heavily in long-term U.S. treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities which you could say was their first mistake- lack of diversification. When the Federal Reserve decided to hike up interest rates to combat inflation in 2022, SVB’s bond and treasury portfolio started to drop. And because they decided not to protect their investments with other, short term investments for quick and easy liquidation, they became insolvent because they could not liquidate their assets without substantial loss. This became a huge problem when economic factors hit the tech industry and many of SVB’s bank customers withdrew money. Going back to lack of diversification, SVB didn't have the cash available to fulfill such withdrawals so they had to act fast. They decided to announce they needed to raise almost 2 billions dollars in capital and resorted to selling their bonds and treasuries at a significant loss. Shortly after, customers became worrisome which led to a bank run. People started withdrawing money in waves and SVB’s stock declined 60%. California regulators eventually shut down the bank and placed SVB under the FDIC.

            <h4>What are some future implications?</h4>
            <p>
                Silicon Valley Bank supported many small businesses and funded many different businesses worldwide. 
                The crash forced many small businesses to shut down entirely or lay off most of the workers because they would be unable to pay salaries. The Silicon Valley Bank crash is the biggest banking failure since the financial crisis of 2008, and the effects of the crash will be felt within the technology field for years to come. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said, “With SVB in essence the Godfather of the Silicon Valley banking ecosystem for the past few decades in the tech world, we believe the negative ripple impact of this historical collapse will have a myriad of implications for the tech world going forward.” However, federal officials are attempting to take precautionary measures to reduce the risks of other banks crashing; the Federal Reserve Bond has made funding accessible for banks to use, so they are not at risk of crashing, which ultimately helps ensure we do not fall into another recession.
