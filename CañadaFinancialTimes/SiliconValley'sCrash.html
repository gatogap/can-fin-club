                    “On March 10, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was closed by regulators, marking the largest US bank failure since the Global Financial Crisis in the late 2000s (and second largest in US history)” (Fidelity, 2023, p. 1). <br><br>

					We are all familiar with the 2008 Housing crisis and bankruptcies, but their causes differ from what happened to Silicon Valley’s bank. Silicon Valley’s downfall is similar to December 2022’s FTX and March 2023’s Signature Bank crash, all of which lack of liquidity was the culprit. <br><br>

					Okay, so SVB closed down on March 10th, but why and who does it impact? What are its learning outcomes? Famous tech companies like Roblox, Chinese Biotech, and European companies had large deposits. Roku, for example, had “roughly $487 million, or 26 percent, of its $1.9 billion in cash … with Silicon Valley Bank” (May, 2023, p. 4). Fortunately, the Federal Reserve has guaranteed all depositors’ money back except shareholders’. <br><br>

					Let’s go in-depth about how the Federal Reserve’s attempt to counter inflation by increasing interest rates, an absence of risk management, uninsured deposits, high-interest long-term bonds, and excessive client withdrawals led to the Bank’s downfall and quick recovery. <br><br>

                Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) provided financing for about half of all venture-funded technology and healthcare companies in the United States. SVB was favored by most startups, particularly tech startups, because of their willingness to support such companies when most other banks consider them high-risk. Their desire to support such companies was primarily due to the pandemic when there was a thriving market for start-up tech companies that commonly have negative cash flows. With a large influx of cash, SVB’s services were in high demand, specifically their ability to hold money for payroll. <br><br>
				
				With all this cash, SVB invested heavily in long-term U.S. treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities, which was their first mistake- lack of diversification despite a long-term bond’s steady return. Because of their steady returns, they are perceived to be safer than stocks. Furthermore, SVB’s profit would be the difference of a high-rate long-term bond and a low deposit rate cost for deposits. To make matters worse, it didn’t help that SVB had no official chief risk officer for eight months to prevent the bad economic maneuvers explained below. <br><br>

				Initially, the Federal Reserve ignored the inflation and supposed it was temporary. After some time, they decided to finally act in 2021 by rapidly increasing interest rates to compensate for the late response. Consequently, SVB’s bond and treasury portfolio dropped. New bonds lost attraction for higher interest rates and older bonds lost value and demand drastically. And because they decided not to protect their investments with other, short-term investments for quick and easy liquidation, they became insolvent because they could not liquidate their assets without substantial loss. Finally, the lack of investment diversity and loss of long-term value became evident when economic factors hit the tech industry. Companies couldn’t pay their employees, and crowds of SVB’s bank customers withdrew more money than the bank had because of the long-term bond losses.<br><br>

				SVB had no cash to repay withdrawals, so they had to act fast. They resorted to raising almost 2 billion dollars in capital and selling their bonds and treasuries at a significant loss of $1.8 billion. They could have waited for their bonds to reach maturity. People started withdrawing money in waves, resulting in the bank’s negative $198 balance. Moreover, SVB’s stock declined by 60%. California regulators eventually shut down the bank and placed SVB under the FDIC. <br><br>

                After the chaotic responses to the Federal Reserve’s change to interest rates, shareholders are suing the CEO and CFO of SVB for fraud. CEO of SVB, Greg Becker, was removed from the reserve bank of San Fransisco because of his lack of supervision on SVB. FDIC has transferred SVB’s deposits into a holding bank and named Tim Mayopolis as the new CEO of SVB.<br><br>

				As we have hinted earlier, the crash forced many small businesses to shut down entirely or lay off most of the workers because they would be unable to pay salaries. The Federal Reserve has removed the $250,000 max recovery regulation on closed banks to reduce the risks of other banks crashing. Now, larger banks could back up smaller banks like SVB whenever they can no longer pay their clients back. This bank term funding program enables impacted banks to sell the FED their long-term bonds and securities to prevent another recession. Since the program's establishment, Biden has announced that this bank funding program will return all client’s gross deposits. However, since this is a new program, flaws have not yet been discovered and may impact corporations on a larger scale since larger banks are now liable for a high-risk bank’s bankruptcy. <br>
