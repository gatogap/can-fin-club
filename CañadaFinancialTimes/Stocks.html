        <h4>Introduction​</h4>
        <p>
            Moreover, you may ask “How are stocks interpreted?” 
            As a beginner, it is essential to get familiar with two approaches: Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis. 
            These are two conditional forms to evaluate a stock’s potential. ​
        </p>

        <h4>Basic Terms:​</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bullish</strong>: In a market’s price graph, this is when the price illustrates an upward trend like the example below:
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assets</strong>: Resources that profit a Company such as machinery for production. 
            In the case of stocks, investors purchase a fraction of the company, which in turn gives the company a source of profit. 
            The stock system itself is an asset to the company/our investments are assets to a company. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bearish</strong>: In a market’s price graph, this is when the price demonstrates a downward trend.
            ​</li>
            <li><strong>Stock/equality</strong>: A fraction/percentage of a company’s total asset security. ​
            Example: “I’ve decided to sell my 1% ownership of this company because of its sudden Bearish trend.
            ​</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Technical Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            Technical Analysis is the optimization of “math/statistical” tools to <strong> predict a Company’s short-term performance </strong> depending on its stock's historical value and volume on a price over time graph. 
            Short term performance refers to brief volatile stock behaviors. 
            While these statistical tools are used, technical analysis also evaluates a security's supply and demand.​
        </p>

        <p>On the left is a graph depicting statistical tools/strategies that are frequently used to determine a company’s value</p>

        <h4>Fundamental Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            Fundamental Analysis primarily focuses on the social climate, a company’s production, profit, competitors, and management strategy to determine a company’s value through two different lenses; 
            Quantitative analysis and Qualitative Analysis. ​
            <br><br>
            <strong>Quantitative Analysis</strong> is the use of various numerical data to determine a company’s value. 
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, <strong>qualitative</strong> data measures a company’s value through information that cannot be evaluated numerically. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>Overestimation</strong> of a company’s value could discourage fundamental analysts from investing in them while <br>
            <strong>Underestimations</strong> could attract investors. 
            This method is often used for long-term investments. ​
        </p>

        <h4>Below is a graph depicting the concepts and documents that determine a company's value</h4>
        <p>
            Fundamental Analysis could be divided into two categories --> Quantitative and Qualitative. 
            The listed terms below Quantitative and Qualitative are documents and methods that can be accessed and or researched to conclude the probability of a market's increase (overestimation) or decrease (underestimation). 
            These documentations and research methods are the few of many methods that can assist an investor and analyst.​
        </p>
        
        <h4>Investment Lesson</h4>
        <p>
            All in all, many investment research methods are derived from Technical and Fundamental Analysis, two of which have different strategies to determine an investment of a company's security. 
            Technical applies statistical tools (such as averages) on market price trends to predict the next short-term bullish or bearish trend. ​
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, Fundamental analysis evaluates/judges a company's long-term value based on Quantitative factors and Qualitative factors outside of a Company's price graphs. 
            Quantitative factors include numerical data such as a company's income statement and Qualitative is concerned with data that cannot be depicted numerically such as a Company's Management procedures. ​
